\begin{proof}[Answer]
%Your answer goes here
$\{C,D\}$, $\{B,E\}$, and $\{A,G\}$ are \textbf{safe} edges with respect to  $\mathcal{F}$ because they are each the minimum weight edges that crosses a partition of the vertices (a cut), so they are each light edges. Since any light edge that connects two components in an intermediate spanning forest is safe, they are safe.  \\
$\{B,G\}$, $\{G,E\}$, $\{G,F\}$, $\{D,E\}$ are  \textbf{undecided} edges with respect to  $\mathcal{F}$ because they are neither safe, nor useless \\
There are no edges that will create a cycle with respect to $\mathcal{F}$ so there are no useless edges. \\
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\{C,D\}$ is the minimum weight edge with exactly one endpoint in the the component $\{A,B,C,G\}$ and the minimum weight edge with exactly one edge in the component $\{F,E,D\}$. Therefore $\{C,D\}$ is a light edge and hence a \textbf{safe} edge with respect to  $\mathcal{F}$
\item $\{B,E\}$ is the minimum weight edge with exactly one endpoint in the the component $\{A,B,C,G\}$ and the minimum weight edge with exactly one edge in the component $\{F,E\}$. Therefore $\{B,E\}$ is a light edge and hence a \textbf{safe} edge with respect to  $\mathcal{F}$
\item $\{A,G\}$ is the minimum weight edge with exactly one endpoint in the the component $\{A,B,C,D,E,F\}$ and the minimum weight edge with exactly one edge in the component $\{G\}$. Therefore $\{A,G\}$ is a light edge and hence a \textbf{safe} edge with respect to  $\mathcal{F}$ \\

See below for a visual of the safe edges \\

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{hw3problem1} \\

\item While the edge $\{B,G\}$ has exactly one endpoint in the component $\{A,B,C,D,E,F\}$ and one endpoint in the component $\{G\}$, it is not a minimum weight edge in doing so. Therefore, $\{B,G\}$ is an \textbf{undecided} edge with respect to  $\mathcal{F}$
\item Similarly the edge $\{G,E\}$ has exactly one endpoint in the component $\{A,B,C,D,E,F\}$ and one endpoint in the component ${G}$, but it is not a minimum weight edge in doing so. Therefore, $\{G,E\}$ is an \textbf{undecided} edge with respect to  $\mathcal{F}$
\item Similarly the edge $\{G,F\}$ has exactly one endpoint in the component $\{A,B,C,D,E,F\}$ and one endpoint in the component $\{G\}$, although it is not a minimum weight edge connecting these components. Therefore, $\{G,F\}$ is an \textbf{undecided} edge with respect to  $\mathcal{F}$
\item Lastly, the edge $\{D,E\}$ has exactly one endpoint in the component $\{A,B,C,D,G\}$ and one endpoint in the component $\{E,F\}$, however it is not a minimum weight edge connecting these components. Therefore, $\{D,E\}$ is an \textbf{undecided} edge with respect to  $\mathcal{F}$

\begin{proof}[Answer]
%Your answer goes here

Kruskal's algorithm begins by initializing the intermediate spanning forest $\mathcal{F}$ to contain all the vertices but no edges. Then, it creates a priority queue in which it adds all of the edges of the graph, ordered from lowest weight to highest weight. \\
For this graph, the edges will be added to the queue such that initially 
\\
$Q= [ (\{A,G\}, 6), (\{E,F\}, 7), (\{C,D\}, 8), (\{B,E\}, 10), $
\\
 $(\{A,B\}, 11), (\{B,G\}, 13), (\{E,G\}, 14), (\{F,G\}, 14), (\{B,C\}, 18), (\{D,E\}, 25) ]$ \\
\begin{itemize}
\item Poll from Q, which returns $(\{A,G\}, 6)$. Since A and G are on different components of $\mathcal{F}$, $\{A,G\}$ does not create a cycle so we add it to $\mathcal{F}$. Now the edges of $\mathcal{F}$ are $ [(\{A,G\}, 6)]$ and\\
 $Q= [(\{E,F\}, 7), (\{C,D\}, 8), (\{B,E\}, 10), (\{A,B\}, 11),$ \\
$ (\{B,G\}, 13), (\{E,G\}, 14), (\{F,G\}, 14), (\{B,C\}, 18), (\{D,E\}, 25) ]$ \\
\item Poll from Q, which returns $(\{E,F\}, 7)$. Since E and F are on different components of $\mathcal{F}$, adding that edge would not create a cycle so we add the edge to $\mathcal{F}$. Now the edges of $\mathcal{F}$ are $ [(\{A,G\}, 6), (\{E,F\}, 7)]$ and\\ $Q= [(\{C,D\}, 8), (\{B,E\}, 10), (\{A,B\}, 11), (\{B,G\}, 13), (\{E,G\}, 14), (\{F,G\}, 14), (\{B,C\}, 18), (\{D,E\}, 25) ]$ \\
\item Poll from Q, which returns $(\{C,D\}, 8)$. Since C and D are on different components of $\mathcal{F}$,  adding that edge would not create a cycle so, we add the edge to $\mathcal{F}$. Now the edges of $\mathcal{F}$ are $[(\{A,G\}, 6), (\{E,F\}, 7), (\{C,D\}, 8)]$ and  \\
$Q= [ (\{B,E\}, 10), (\{A,B\}, 11), (\{B,G\}, 13), (\{E,G\}, 14), (\{F,G\}, 14), (\{B,C\}, 18), (\{D,E\}, 25) ]$ \\
\end{itemize}

The algorithm will continue in this method, polling each edge from the priority queue and checking if it creates a cycle. If it does NOT create a cycle, the edge is added to $\mathcal{F}$. However, if it does create a cycle, meaning the two vertices are on the same component of $\mathcal{F}$, then the edge will NOT be added to $\mathcal{F}$. \\
So $(\{B,E\}, 10)$ will be the next added edge, followed by  $(\{A,B\}, 11)$ and lastly  $(\{B,C\}, 18)$\\

The algorithm terminates when $\mathcal{F}$ spans all vertices, and at which point $\mathcal{F}$ has $|V(G)|-1 = 7-1= 6$ edges and is the MST of the graph. \\
For this graph, the MST $\mathcal{F}$ contains the following edges and is pictured below \\
$ [(\{A,G\}, 6), (\{E,F\}, 7), (\{C,D\}, 8), (\{B,E\}, 10), (\{A,B\}, 11),  (\{B,C\}, 18)]$. \\

\begin{proof}[Answer]
%Your answer goes here 

\begin{itemize}
\item Initialize the intermediate spanning forest, $\mathcal{F}$,  to contain all of the vertices of G, but no edges. Then initialize the priority queue to contain the edges incident to the source vertex A. The priority queue will order the edges from lowest to highest weights.\\
So at the start $Q= [ (\{A,G\}, 6), (\{A,B\}, 11) ]$ 
\item Poll the edge $\{A,G\}$ from Q and mark $\{A,G\}$ as processed. $\{A,G\}$ has exactly one endpoint on the component containing A, hence it does not create a cycle, so we add $\{A,G\}$ to $\mathcal{F}$. Then push the unprocessed edges incident to G onto the queue. \\
So $Q= [ (\{A,B\}, 11), (\{G,B\}, 13), (\{G,E\}, 14), (\{G,F\}, 14) ]$ 
\item Poll the edge $\{A,B\}$ from Q and mark it as processed. $\{A,B\}$ has exactly one endpoint on the component containing A, so we add $\{A,B\}$ to $\mathcal{F}$. Then push the unprocessed edges incident to B (that are not already in Q) onto the queue. \\
So $Q= [ (\{B,E\}, 10), (\{G,B\}, 13), (\{G,E\}, 14), (\{G,F\}, 14), (\{B,C\}, 18)]$ 
\item Now poll the edge $\{B,E\}$ from Q and mark it as processed. $\{B,E\}$ has exactly one endpoint on the component containing A, so we add $\{B,E\}$ to $\mathcal{F}$. Then push the unprocessed edges incident to E (that are not already in Q) onto the queue. \\
So $Q= [ (\{E,F\}, 7), (\{G,B\}, 13), (\{G,E\}, 14), (\{G,F\}, 14), (\{B,C\}, 18), (\{E,D\}, 25)]$ 
\item Now poll the edge $\{E,F\}$ from Q and mark it as processed. $\{E,F\}$ has exactly one endpoint on the component containing A, so we add $\{E,F\}$ to $\mathcal{F}$. Since there are no edges incident to F that are not already in Q, we do not push any new edges. \\
So $Q= [ (\{G,B\}, 13), (\{G,E\}, 14), (\{G,F\}, 14), (\{B,C\}, 18), (\{E,D\}, 25)]$ 
\item Now poll the edge $\{G,B\}$ from Q and mark it as processed. As both G and B belong to the component containing A, we do NOT add it to $\mathcal{F}$.\\
Now $Q= [ (\{G,E\}, 14), (\{G,F\}, 14), (\{B,C\}, 18), (\{E,D\}, 25)]$ 
\item Now poll the edge $\{G,E\}$ from Q and mark it as processed. As both G and E belong to the component containing A, we do NOT add it to $\mathcal{F}$.\\
Now $Q= [ (\{G,F\}, 14), (\{B,C\}, 18), (\{E,D\}, 25)]$ 
\item Now poll the edge $\{G,F\}$ from Q and mark it as processed. As both G and F belong to the component containing A, we do NOT add it to $\mathcal{F}$.\\
Now $Q= [ (\{B,C\}, 18), (\{E,D\}, 25)]$ 
\item Now poll the edge $\{B,C\}$ from Q and mark it as processed. $\{B,C\}$ has exactly one endpoint on the component containing A, so we add $\{B,C\}$ to $\mathcal{F}$. Then push the unprocessed edges incident to C (that are not already in Q) onto the queue. \\
Now $Q= [ (\{C,D\}, 8), (\{E,D\}, 25)]$ 
\item Now poll the edge $\{C,D\}$ from Q and mark it as processed. $\{C,D\}$ has exactly one endpoint on the component containing A, so we add $\{C,D\}$ to $\mathcal{F}$. Since there are no edges incident to D that are not already in Q, we do not push any new edges. \\
Now $Q= [ (\{E,D\}, 25)]$ 
\item Now poll the edge $\{E,D\}$ from Q and mark it as processed. As both E and D belong to the component containing A, we do NOT add it to $\mathcal{F}$. Note: $\{E,D\}$ is the max weight edge, which will never be added to the MST \\
Now $Q= []$ and $\mathcal{F}$ has $|V(G)|-1 = 7-1= 6$ edges so the algorithm terminates and returns $\mathcal{F}$ as shown below. 
\end{itemize}
For this graph, the MST $\mathcal{F}$ contains the following edges added in this order \\
$ [(\{A,G\}, 6), (\{A,B\}, 11), (\{B,E\}, 10), (\{E,F\}, 7), (\{B,C\}, 18), (\{C,D\}, 8)]$.
